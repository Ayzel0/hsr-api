# Honkai: Star Rail API

This is an API wrapper built on top of Project Yatta's API (https://sr.yatta.moe/api/v2/) written in Golang.

The intention behind the project is to create an API with better documentation than current and to support existing project development (for myself and other developers working on Honkai Star Rail projects). It's also mostly so that I can learn Golang.

## Feature Checklist
- Asynchronous capability
- Persistent caching with Redis

Will tackle these as I go through developing the API.

PRs are appreciated.
